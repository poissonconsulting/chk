# Expect Chk Error

`expect_chk_error()` checks that code throws an error of class
`"chk_error"` with a message that matches regexp. See below for more
details.

## Usage

``` r
expect_chk_error(
  object,
  regexp = NULL,
  ...,
  info = NULL,
  label = NULL,
  class = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  Object to test.

  Supports limited unquoting to make it easier to generate readable
  failures within a function or for loop. See
  [quasi_label](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/quasi_label.html)
  for more details.

- regexp:

  Regular expression to test against.

  - A character vector giving a regular expression that must match the
    error message.

  - If `NULL`, the default, asserts that there should be an error, but
    doesn't test for a specific value.

  - If `NA`, asserts that there should be no errors, but we now
    recommend using
    [`expect_no_error()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_no_error.html)
    and friends instead.

  Note that you should only use `message` with errors/warnings/messages
  that you generate. Avoid tests that rely on the specific text
  generated by another package since this can easily change. If you do
  need to test text generated by another package, either protect the
  test with `skip_on_cran()` or use `expect_snapshot()`.

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`expect_match`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_match.html)

  `fixed`

  :   If `TRUE`, treats `regexp` as a string to be matched exactly (not
      a regular expressions). Overrides `perl`.

  `perl`

  :   logical. Should Perl-compatible regexps be used?

- info:

  Extra information to be included in the message. This argument is
  soft-deprecated and should not be used in new code. Instead see
  alternatives in
  [quasi_label](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/quasi_label.html).

- label:

  Used to customise failure messages. For expert use only.

- class:

  Must be NULL.

## Value

If `regexp = NA`, the value of the first argument; otherwise the
captured condition.

## Testing `message` vs `class`

When checking that code generates an error, it's important to check that
the error is the one you expect. There are two ways to do this. The
first way is the simplest: you just provide a `regexp` that match some
fragment of the error message. This is easy, but fragile, because the
test will fail if the error message changes (even if its the same
error).

A more robust way is to test for the class of the error, if it has one.
You can learn more about custom conditions at
<https://adv-r.hadley.nz/conditions.html#custom-conditions>, but in
short, errors are S3 classes and you can generate a custom class and
check for it using `class` instead of `regexp`.

If you are using `expect_error()` to check that an error message is
formatted in such a way that it makes sense to a human, we recommend
using
[`expect_snapshot()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_snapshot.html)
instead.
